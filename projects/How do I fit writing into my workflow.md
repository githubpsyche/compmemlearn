## How do I fit writing into my workflow?

Well first, let's consider my current workflow. I write lots of notes when I work on a project. These notes deeply evaluate literature, propose out analyze substantive research questions, and deeply work through the specification and implications of different data analyses.

To a wild extent, I already do lots of writing! So a minimalist strategy for fitting paper production into this workflow is maybe to try harder to write these notes in a format appropriate for academic journals, and to place then in a context where they can be read and edited by collaborators as potential submissions to academic journals.

The Russian doll vault structure aimed for this, but paradoxically, I feel bogged down. Why is that?

A lot of empty files with no clear direction. Slow iteration, ambiguous constraints. How do I normally overcome this? Planning picks elements in the pile for top priority and defines success conditions that provide room to proceed forward. And implementation of tests to enable interactive iteration on a task element.

I can do that with writing. It seems the trick is to include writing in the plan.

As for writing as I go, I have sketched some potential ways I might store notes within my paper drafts and initiate then w/ rough
nature language. I can use the past tense and an expository tone, and hold out notes -for-me from likely draft notes by maybe embracing a Q-and- A format.

And what about feedback? Quarto preview should be a guarantee for my project. Is this enough? I'd say it kind of is but I certainly have plenty of work to do to out this strategy into effect. First I have to start quarto preview for the project of interest. Then I have to decide on which objective to prioritize. Then I have to specify the increments that will get me there and analyze success conditions. Cool okay let's do this.

If I'm not using the notebooks as source files, why don't I use tex files again? Especially if I might stick to VSCode as my preferred latex editor? I really am a lot closer to being able to use VSCode for what Obsidian is for. 

Hmm. Pros and Cons.

Sticking with quarto leaves open the possibility of html rendering, notebooks-as-assets, easier as-you-go previewing, and synchrony with obsidian.

But obsidian doesn't have any special features per se. I can achieve html rendering just with a notebook and nbviewer. And separating figure assets from the notebook provides more flexibility for composition. Synchrony with overleaf is more valuable than synchrony with obsidian. So okay, let's do this.

Where will I collect report variations and whatnot? In the reports subdirectory.
