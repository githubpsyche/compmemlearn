Today before I fall asleep again, I want to pull off:

Get entire compmemlearn pushed. Might have to rebase commits to make this work. Is rebase the word?
Set up wordpool construct for codebase, focusing on Becky's requests but prepping for PEERS and narrative wordpools
Individual and phenomenawise fits and summary stat dfs as csvs for Becky

Remember to add a test to subjectwise model fitting that ensures wordpool is right

While I have trouble getting to sleep, I want to update...
crp code (make sure it plots right in subjectwise fitting report)
rpl code (add jitter)
flexibility of subjectwise model fitting specification
log likelihood distribution plots (refactor outside and clean up labeling)

this will clear the way for me to tackle the introduction w/ full vigor

the cdcatbeh dataset has intrusions. have i been properly accounting for it? If not, how should I?

I think for now I need to make sure there are no intrusions in my datasets.

PEERS.csv has intrusions.
And so does CDCATBEH.

Okay, that's addressed otherwise. What next?

First I got events_metadata.

Next is Distance CRP code. 
Then I can do the likelihood and simulation code.
