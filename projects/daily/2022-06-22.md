Use pre-existing parameters.
Simulate benchmark statistics as we manipulate...

## List Length
Eg from 12 to 90
(Flatter CRP)
Vary presentations

## Retention Interval Length
Included a Beta-i distraction parameter that simulates a distraction event. Is supposed to exclusively affect recency effect.

## Retrieval Practice
Exp 6 fitting code tackled this
Vary item sequence

## Semantic Structure
msem where categorized items have connectivity 1
catCRP and lagCRP

## Involved Demos...
Experiment 5 varies list length and retention interval duration. It is unaffected  
by the length of the retention interval but is reliably weakened with increased list length. 

If we get that, then

Experiment 2
