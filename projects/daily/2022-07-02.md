Item index in sbs dataset should be item as in Healy.

Item in sbs dataset should be item_string as in healy

Item string index is useless as I specify it now. Ideally would be a datasetwide index into distances array. I might try to code it or I might ignore at this point and specify as an issue.

Other columns can be left as is.

Which mains I'm mainly altering column names and moving this notebook into root compmemlearn.

I should have done this before I left. Too much gui stuff to tackle now.

I have some nans in my item string list. I need to figure out why. Oh, it's the variable list lengths thing. Ughh.
