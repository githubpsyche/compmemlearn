Free recall drift rate beats free encoding drift rate
free stop probability growth beats free encoing drift rate

free encoding drift rate beats several parameters:
free learning rate
free primacy scale
free semantisc scale

free stop probability growth beats free start drift rate

free start drift rate also beats:
free stop probability



groups...

```
learning rate
primacy scale
semantic scale

stop_probabability_scale
primacy decay
delay drift rate
encoding drift rate

item_support

start drift rate
shared_support

choice sensitivity

stop probability growth
recall drift rate
```

in second pass, groups are...

```

primacy_scale

semantic_scale

stop_probability_scale
delay_drift_rate

primacy_decay
encoding_drift_rate

item_support
shared_support

start_drift_rate

learning_rate
choice_sensitivity

stop_probability_growth
```

Any big changes?

learning_rate became a lot more influential

In third pass, groups are...

```
stop probability scale
semantic scale

primacy scale

shared support

learning rate
encoding drift rate
item support
primacy decay

delay drift rate
start drift rate

choice sensitivity
