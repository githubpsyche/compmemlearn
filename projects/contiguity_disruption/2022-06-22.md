Use pre-existing parameters.
Simulate benchmark statistics as we manipulate...

## List Length
Eg from 12 to 90
(Flatter CRP)
Vary presentations

## Retention Interval Length
Included a Beta-i distraction parameter that simulates a distraction event. Is supposed to exclusively affect recency effect.
Issues using `delay_drift_rate`. Using a noise vector works. Will I keep this for the whole model? Hopefully not -- a random vector each iteration will screw up log-likelihood calculation. May have to get into random seed details and the like.

## Retrieval Practice
Exp 6 fitting code tackled this
Vary item sequence

study list, shuffle, study again

## Semantic Structure
msem where categorized items have connectivity 1
catCRP and lagCRP

15 categories, 6 items from each list

## Involved Demos...
Experiment 5 varies list length and retention interval duration. It is unaffected  
by the length of the retention interval but is reliably weakened with increased list length. 

If we get that, then
