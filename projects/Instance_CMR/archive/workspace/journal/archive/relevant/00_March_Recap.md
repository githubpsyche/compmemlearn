# March 7 Recap
 
## Recap 
I think I want to re-organize my journal entries to make for clearer increments.

### Review
What do I want to bring with me?
- Initial Motivation is worth keeping
- Clean_Optimized_ICMR has some timings for my numba-optimized ICMR that I need to make sure I can still match; once I can, it can go into dustbin
- CMR_and_ICMR_Are_Different will get revisited more than once
- Feb24 has some reflection about what ICMR offers context and instance theorists
- Instane Context Thoughts tries to compare/contrast our model of context w/ Jamieson et al's
- Jamieson_2018 and Jamieson_2018_2 try to dig more deeply into difference between distributional and instance-based models that goes beyond the misconception that latter enables retrieval of individual traces
- Jan 22 is when stuff starts coming together and i outline my milestone plan
- Jan 27 is a followup. Not as fleshed out. Some details on argdown.
- March 3 is like this, veers to focus on comparison against Jamieson et al 2018
- Optimizing_ICMR_With_Numba also has some timings for my numba-optimized ICMR that I need to make sure I can still match; once I can, it can go into dustbin
- Paper Sketch starts out brainstorming what a paper might look like

What's useful but orthogonal from current project course?
- Expanded Model Analyses has some interesting notes that could help pull together a single-store ICMR. Orthogonal to current project course though

What's probably okay putting into the dustbin?
- Model_Debugging can be forgotten.
- Same for trying_nbdev
- Feb 3 (pure journal stuff)
- Jan 10 just explores developer style guide and nbdev and jupyterlab extensions
- Jan 11 solves the utf8 problem, docker, 
- Jan 21 is just journal stuff
- Jan 28 is journal stuff
- Timing Model Fit is just an old notebook

### How Do I Manage These?
I could try maintaining an index based on this one. 

I'll sort these into some subfolders (`extraneous` and `still_relevant`) and for now on try to index journal entries like I am regular notebooks.
