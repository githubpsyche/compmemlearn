I need a fresh notebook to clear my head.

What can I do in an hour?

Let's keep it concrete: write the code that runs both models and generates encoding states, etc.

8:55
**We'll remove memory plotting from `encoding_visualizations` and make a new helper function in this notebook.** 
Can still get a lot of use out of plot_states, though - it's literally just an arbitrary matrix plotter.

8:55
**Encoding contexts are initially identical across models, but item supports differ**. Reflects differences in activation/outcome_probability functions that I might be able to equalize.
