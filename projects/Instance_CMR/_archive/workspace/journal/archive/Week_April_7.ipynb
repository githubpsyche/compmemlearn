    "So the data I need to figure out whether Jamieson et al (2018)'s version of the critique of prototype-based models applies wrt free recall seems to be a little different from the Lohnas et al dataset I've been analyzing lately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Lohnas dataset, subjects encountered four different types of lists: \n",
    "1. Control lists that contained all once-presented items;  \n",
    "2. pure massed lists containing all twice-presented items; \n",
    "3. pure spaced lists consisting of items presented twice at lags 1-8, where lag is defined as the number of intervening items between a repeated item's presentations; \n",
    "4. mixed lists consisting of once presented, massed and spaced items. Within each session, subjects encountered three lists of each of these four types. \n",
    "\n",
    "What I need is a list type with repetitions of massed repetitions where the number of presentations in each mass varies within item. In other words, I'm hopeful that I can find a dataset where an item is presented one or a couple times in succession at one point, and maybe several times in succession at another, all before participants perform retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big idea is that the core of Jamieson et al's critique of prototype-based models is that abstraction-at-encoding makes records of rarer contextual correspondences relatively inaccessible in item's contextual representations compared to when your model performs abstraction-at-retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is a graded problem across the continuous modulations in meaning that are inherent to polysemous words as well. Jones suggests that this behavior is not a simple problem that can be handily solved with a patch in abstraction-at-learning DSMs, but rather indicates that the models may be fundamentally wrong in how they conceive of semantics. In short, although they can represent the average meaning of a word, they do so at the cost of being able to represent meanings that differ from the average (e.g., rare senses of homonyms and polysemes), a behavior that is rapid and natural to humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jamieson et al's analysis focuses on when a memory probe contains information about an item's feature representation plus some disambiguating contextual information (e.g. the word \"break\" plus the sense-disambiguating word \"news\"), but I've realized lately that this distinction between prototype-based and instance-based models probably applies even when a cue is purely contextual rather than compound. In that case, the retrieved representation is no longer necessarily selective for information about a specific item, but we still expect a difference between instance-based and prototype-based models in the extent to which rarer contexts of an item figure into the retrieved representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptualizing the distinction this way makes the consequences of Jamieson et a's critique potentially a bit broader than he initially argues. In the context maintenance and retrieval model, the major consequence will arise when using its $M_{CF}$ representation to retrieve item activations to organize retrieval. In the prototype-based implementation of the model, we expect weaker retrieval for items when cued with their \"rare\" contexts than in instance-based implementations of the model, given similar parameters. We further expect a difficult trade-off for prototype-based models with parameters fitted to enhance retrieval of items' \"rare contexts\": deflated activation for items when memory is cued with their more prominent contextual representations. Since instance-based models can flexibly produce nonlinear activation of stored instances based on contextual cues, this trade-off is unique to prototype-based models that commit to a single pattern of contextual associations for an item at encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one model fits better to behavioral data while this distinction has been proven to hold, the result would be important constraints for further modeling of free recall."
