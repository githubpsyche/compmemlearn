### Claims
Linear separability is a requirement for a prototype strategy to yield perfect classification performance (Reed, 1972).

Architectures make different claims about tests of generalization to new transfer stimuli. It is critical to test the models on their ability to predict generalization to new transfer stimuli as well as to old.

However, as was explained by Nosofsky and Zaki (2002), within the framework of the multiplicative-similarity prototype model, the y parameter cannot be estimated separately from the sensitivity parameter, c.

### Details
The stimuli were line drawings of bug-like creatures. There are two categories, A and B, composed of seven exemplars each. The exemplars vary along six binary-valued dimensions (e.g., short or long body, closed green eye or opened red eye, etc). Logical value 1 on each dimension tends to indicate category A membership, whereas logical value 2 tends to indicate category B membership. Other dimensions aren't much diagnostic at all. 

On each trial, one of the training patterns would appear on the computer screen, the subject would classify it, and feedback was then provided.

Found that it was more difficult to distinguish predictions from the mixed prototype and instance models on training instances alone.

### Qualitative Contrasts
Models learn an attention weight to each feature of the stimuli.

To help understand model performance, they found training instances that, along attended dimensions, are ambiguous concerning category membership: half of attended dimension values point to category A, and the other half point to category B. 

Next, they found new transfer stimuli that matched the critical training stimulus along the attended dimensions. (They are still different along unattended dimensions.) These are called *neighbors* of the critical training stimulus. 

GCM assumes that the generalization of new transfer stimuli is based on similarity to specific exemplars. Therefore, it tends to predict that the neighbors are classified with high probability into the same category as the critical training stimulus.

By contrast, because the mixed prototype model assumes that the generalization of new transfer stimuli is based on similarity to the prototype, it tends to predict that the neighbors are classified with roughly equal probability into each category. The reason is that half of the neighbor's attended dimensions point to category A while the other half point to category B.

### Connections
Episodic memory models use temporal contextual representations as cues to retrieve appropriate item representations. 

Categorization models use multidimensional item representations as cues to retrieve an appropriate category label.

We can think of list items as category labels and temporal contextual states as the multidimensional feature configurations that are to be classified.

Are there critical training instances in CMR? That would be temporal contextual representations that are ambiguous concerning item identity. That's impossible, right?

Hmm. Let's try to generalize. Get a temporal contextual cue that is ambiguous between two items: it's just as similar to the contextual representation for A as it is for B. Prototype models predict ambivalence. Instance models don't.

No, this is different. In their paradigm

### Likely Follow-Up
> A classic issue in the field of category learning concerns the contrast between exemplar and prototype models. 

> There is a good deal of evidence that prototype models are insufficient as models of classification. Memories for individual exemplars appear to play at least some role in classification learning, especially in situations in which category size is small (Homa, Sterling, & Trepel, 1981; Nosofsky, 1992; Posner & Keele, 1968; Smith & Minda, 2000). 

I have to follow up on this. specific examples of distinctions drawn between instance and prototype models.
