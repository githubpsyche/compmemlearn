# Jones, M. N. (Ed.). (2017). _Big data in cognitive science_. New York, NY, USA:: Routledge.

This has a lot of interesting chapters but isn't directly relevant for writing the InstanceCMR introduction.

When would I actually revisit this? Hard to say.

## Quotations
> Big Data sources are now allowing cognitive scientists to evaluate theoretical models and make new discoveries at a resolution not previously possible. For example, we can now use online services like Netflix, Amazon, and Yelp to evaluate theories of decision-making in the real world and at an unprecedented scale. Wikipedia edit histories can be analyzed to explore information transmission and problem solving across groups. Linguistic corpora allow us to quantitatively evaluate theories of language adaptation over time and generations (Lupyan & Dale, 2010) and models of linguistic entrainment (Fusaroli, Perlman, Mislove, Paxton, Matlock, & Dale, 2015). Massive image repositories are being used to advance models of vision and perception based on natural scene statistics (Griffiths, Abbott, & Hsu, 2016; Khosla, Raju, Torralba, & Oliva, 2015). Twitter and Google search trends can be used to track the outbreak and spread of “infectious” ideas, memory contagion, and information transmission (Chen & Sakamoto, 2013; Masicampo & Ambady, 2014; Wu, Hofman, Mason, & Watts, 2011). Facebook feeds can be manipulated2 to explore information diffusion in social networks (Bakshy, Rosenn, Marlow, & Adamic, 2012; Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock, 2014). Theories of learning can be tested at large scales and in real classroom settings (Carvalho, Braithwaite, de Leeuw, Motz, & Goldstone, 2016; Fox, Hearst, & Chi, 2014). Speech logs afford both theoretical advancements in auditory speech processing, and practical advancements in automatic speech comprehension systems
