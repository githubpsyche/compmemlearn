    "## Transition Lopsidedness\n",
    "For spaced items (lag >= 4) in mixed lists, we determine the proportion of times, given that a subject made a transition from an item in $S_i = {i-2, i-1}$ or $S_j = {j-2, j-1}$ during free recall, that the they would then transition to recall the item in ${i, j}$ where $i$ and $j$ identify the serial positions of the item's two presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To control for the proportion of these transitions expected in the absence of repeated items, we assign the same serial positions used in the mixed lists to corresponding items in the control lists. For each subject, we assign these positions to 100 random shuffles of the control lists, and take the mean across the reshuffled datasets to get a baseline expectation of transition lopsidedness."
