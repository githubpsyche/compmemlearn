![[general - specify and optimize Report Templates Workflow]]

It looks like everything in the flow chart from [[general - specify and optimize Report Templates Workflow]] is working and I primarily need to work on remaining kinks impacting the pdf. How do I reproduce that error? Run quarto preview again? Do I have the corresponding notebook? I should probably reproduce the report files.
