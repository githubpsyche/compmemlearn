the idea for improving my project's handling of semantics is to mate it so I can retrieve all relevant embeddings or perhaps distances themselves by passing a string-index df column right into a numeric way. This way, I never actually to my further string processing after that first data processing loop. Is this haste?

Normal practice in other functions has been to retrieve requirements for analysis from events data frame as a queried list of vectors and arrays.

I previously extended this tradition by pulling an item strings array. Then with a novel language model argument, I converted these into distances. What instead? Specify a word pool argument instead. Word pool arguments at notebook level specify retrieval at initialization of an array whose indices match with string its specified in various datasets. When I pass a non-None word pool as an argument to a report template, I will. Okay, I already know this.

Inside semantic CRP, events metadata retrieves array of string indices that I convert into distances using wordpool and a cosine similarity function. Same for the likelihood and simulation functions. The big advance over before is that I only generate distances a Max of once per unique word per notebook execution. And index of many words per trial is kept easy. Ok!

I think I make a separate function that takes a language model and word list to retrieve embeddings. But this isn't flexible enough. If I'm gonna handle category structure and whatnot, it needs to be a retrieved pd. Okay.

Update...
âœ… Each dataset using words so string indices correspond to a reasonable target.
Priorities are cdcatbeh and all datasets using PEERS word pool. But several others also relevant, like narrative
Events metadata so it retrieves eventwise string ids

Distance CRP, likelihood, simulate_from_df so it accepts word pool argument and uses item IDs to sample.

And word pool generator code...
Cdcatbeh needs like 3 (category, two or three distance metrics)
At least one for peers word pool datasets
And at least one for narrative
