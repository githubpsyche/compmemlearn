\markdownRendererHeadingOne{Context Maintenance and Retrieval within an Instance-Based Architecture}\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator
{}Our instance-based implementation of the context maintenance and retrieval model (InstanceCMR) realizes the retrieved context account of memory search \markdownRendererCite{1}+{as\markdownRendererNbsp{}articulated\markdownRendererNbsp{}by}{}{morton2016predictive} within the instance-based MINERVA 2 model architecture \markdownRendererCite{1}+{}{}{hintzman1984minerva}. To make comparison of architectures as straightforward as possible, mechanisms were deliberately specified to be as similar to those of the original prototypical specification as possible except where required by the constraints of the instance-based architecture.\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator

{}Prototypical CMR stores associations between item feature representations (represented a pattern of weights in an item layer $F$) and temporal context (represented in a contextual layer $C$) by integrating prototypical mappings between the representations via Hebbian learning over the course of encoding. In contrast, InstanceCMR tracks the history of interactions between context and item features by storing a discrete record of each experience, even repeated ones, as separate traces within in a memory store for later inspection. Memory for each experience is encoded as a separate row in an $m$ by $n$ memory matrix $M$ where rows correspond to memory traces and columns correspond to features. Each trace representing a pairing $i$ of a presented itemâ€™s features $f_i$ and the temporal context of its presentation $c_i$ is encoded as a concatenated vector:\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator
