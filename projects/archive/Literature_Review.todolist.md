# Literature Review To Do List

What's left to review?

## Nosofsky & Zaki (2002)
[[@nosofsky2002exemplar]]

Deeper qualitative comparisons between GCM and prototype-based alternatives.

From [[@stanton2002comparisons]]:
> However, as was explained by Nosofsky and Zaki (2002), within the framework of the multiplicative-similarity prototype model, the y parameter cannot be estimated separately from the sensitivity parameter, c.

How? And what does this mean?

## Qualitative Contrasts?
From [[@stanton2002comparisons]]:
> A classic issue in the field of category learning concerns the contrast between exemplar and prototype models. 

> There is a good deal of evidence that prototype models are insufficient as models of classification. Memories for individual exemplars appear to play at least some role in classification learning, especially in situations in which category size is small (Homa, Sterling, & Trepel, 1981; Nosofsky, 1992; Posner & Keele, 1968; Smith & Minda, 2000). 

> Although the present category structure did not allow us to develop strong, a priori, qualitative contrasts between the predictions from the models, the complete set of transfer data nevertheless provided a rich source of constraints that was valuable for model testing.

What are these strong qualitative contrasts?

## Nonlinear Category Structures
[[Nonlinear Category Structures]]

From [[@jamieson2018instance]]:
> The categorization literature, for example, has largely converged on the superiority of exemplar-based theories over prototype theories because prototype theories cannot explain human behavior when dealing with category structures that are nonlinearly separated, such as in classic XOR. 

From [[@stanton2002comparisons]]:
> Linear separability is a requirement for a prototype strategy to yield perfect classification performance (Reed, 1972).

I need to clarify what this means and figure out if it has anything to do with free recall.

## Natural Language Classification

From [[Jamieson, R. K., Avery, J. E., Johns, B. T., & Jones, M. N. (2018). An instance theory of semantic memory. Computational Brain & Behavior, 1(2), 119-136.]]:
> Although we have provided an instance-based DSM to encode word meaning from language experience, Storms et al. ([2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-018-0008-2#ref-CR74 "Storms, G., De Boeck, P., & Ruts, W. (2000). Prototype and exemplar-based information in natural language categories. Journal of Memory and Language, 42, 51–73."))) have examined the distinction between an instance-based and prototype-based approach to natural language classification. In that work, they relied on the generalized context model (Nosofsky [1984](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-018-0008-2#ref-CR61 "Nosofsky, R. M. (1984). Choice, similarity, and the context theory of classification. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, & Cognition, 10, 104–114."), [1986](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-018-0008-2#ref-CR62 "Nosofsky, R. M. (1986). Attention, similarity, and the identification-categorization relationship. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 115, 39–57.")) rather than the MINERVA2 framework. In some of their work, the evidence favored an instance-based conclusion (Smits et al. [2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-018-0008-2#ref-CR71 "Smits, T., Storms, G., Rosseel, Y., & De Boeck, P. (2002). Fruits and vegetables categorized: an application of the generalized context model. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 9, 836–844."); Voorspoels et al. [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-018-0008-2#ref-CR82 "Voorspoels, W., Vanpaemel, W., & Storms, G. (2008). Exemplars and prototypes in natural language concepts: a typicality-based evaluation. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 15, 630–637.")). In other work, their evidence favored an intermediate representation somewhere in between an instance and prototype representation (Verbeemen et al. [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-018-0008-2#ref-CR81 "Verbeemen, T., Vanpaemel, W., Pattyn, S., Storms, G., & Verguts, T. (2007). Beyond exemplars and prototypes as memory representations of natural concepts: a clustering approach. Journal of Memory and Language, 56, 537–554."); Voorspoels et al. [2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-018-0008-2#ref-CR83 "Voorspoels, W., Vanpaemel, W., & Storms, G. (2011). A formal ideal-based account of typicality. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 18, 1006–1014.")). Taken together, their work suggests that it may be naive to pit the instance and prototype DSMs against one another as though they were mutually exclusive.

## Other Sources
For a prototype model, the REMERGE paper has interesting sections about instance models. 

- Reviewing relevant sections of REMERGE paper @20m
- Cited source @60m
- That Mewhort Memory Tesseract paper. @60m
- That paper Sean just linked to @20m

Stuff in my old slides/references.bib....But the other papers in my pre-existing bibliography don't seem to require a second dive. 

Kahana has some discussion of instance models and the persistent challenge people make to them. But that doesn't require a deeper look at this moment.
