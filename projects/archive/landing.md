# InstanceCMR

## Abstract
![[instance_cmr/index]]

This section's main limitation is that it's missing a results statement. I'm also struggling to meet the promises in that last sentence, so it could need to be changed. How do I note this for Sean?

Specifies main requirements for the paper:
1. Explanation of retrieved context theory
2. Review of retrieved context theory's main feats.
3. Explanation of prototype models and linear associators
4. Explanation of instance models
5. Review of contrasts and correspondences between instance and prototype models
6. Relation of these issues to issues in memory search literature
7. Presentation of instance and prototype specifications of CMR, both the math and the "intuition"
8. Simulation of benchmark phenomena and model comparison
9. Simulation and examination of conditions where model predictions might differ
10. Demo extension of model to account for broader pool of phenomena

## Introduction
![[00_Introduction]]

I feel like I need to break this section down, probably into the components listed above. One note for each substantive idea is the game here.

What do I already have here?

Paper starts by starting with problem of pooling information distributed across encoded experiences to retrieve information relevant to a probe. Then gets right into the prototype/instance model debate. A really short version of 3/4. Then a small attempt at 5.

Then 2. Review of benchmark phenomena anyway. Then actual RCT. Then an attempt at 6.

So all the intro components are here, they just aren't very well developed. Ok.
