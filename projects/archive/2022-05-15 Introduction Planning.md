# Introduction Planning

What is it that I want to cover in my introduction?

I want to review the entire literature that contrasts instance- and prototype-based models and explains why the distinction is essential.

I want to introduce the free recall literature and produce principled reasons this debate is relevant to the problem of memory search as well.

I want to enumerate how an instance-based memory differs from a prototype-based memory and lay out the consequences for model performance.

I want a well-motivated research approach for clarifying the significance of these distinctions in the context of memory search research.

How should I organize this effort? First, I'll do an in-depth literature review. I want to understand every paper focused on instance models to their core.

Then I'll work out a checklist and the set of concepts I'm interested in conveying. Anything that looks ambiguous, I'll focus on clarifying. Okay.

This paper has a scanter literature review than it seems.

The point that conflating a central tendency representation makes it harder to retrieve information appropriate for rare contexts is well-taken. Traditional free recall research doesn't have situations like that. Right?

For a clear analog, we need the same item presented multiple times but in a quasi-Zipfian distribution, where the varied context is time rather than linguistic neighbors. This doesn't happen. Right.

So is discussing this issue a distraction? Making a big deal of it probably is.
