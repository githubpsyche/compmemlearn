What is the deal with all these notes and their role in drafting? How do I find and focus on shit in this mess?

Daily notes are one thing, but I think the idea should be to have a unified "directory" of notes/ideas that I can start out and extend.

Each time I increment a project, I'll begin by adding a note to the project landing page!

But how do notes and drafts relate? Ideally, notes are injectable. But that's easier said than done. From a constructionist point of view, I develop ideas as notes and refactor into the paper as an additional step. Okay, that's reasonable sound.

What now?

Landing page for ICMR focused on organizing relevant notes for the paper and where they actually go. Can start with the outline document. But lay off the mindmap thing a little.

It's sort of clear that these daily notes are a pain for navigation.
