I'm interested in picking a singular project landing page for ICMR and deciding how I'll design landing pages going forward.

The latter thing should be a separate issue to ensure I don't forget: [[issues/Specify Landing Page Design in Vault Workflow]]

## Startup
It looks like I have several files that try to do this, most primarily these two:

[[instance_cmr/outline]]
[[planning]]

One seems to focus on providing a tour of the project as it is. The other seems like a workspace aimed at deciding what I'll do next for the project. I want the landing page to sort of be both, right?

[[Vault Workflow]] seems to specify that landing pages summarize what the project is doing, why I'm doing the project, what I've done with the project, and my plan for the project going forward.

How will I pull that off?

An extended paper abstract seems to be close. [[planning]] seems to extend on [[instance_cmr/outline]] by visualizing the project abstract file rather than recapitulating it. That works. Outline proceeds to point to a planning file while planning directly reviews my plans for the component of my project. Outline also includes a rough summary of the project component, something I quite like.

So pooling across all three, my current approach is to...

Start with a tree of project components, roughly approximating sections of a prospective paper, with the highest-level node corresponding to the project abstract/overview.

At each node in the tree, concisely summarize the component using bullet points and link to project assets, including separate planning note(s) if necessary. Stuff in the landing page should primarily explain why the project component is there / what role it plays in the project. Linked notes get into the details.

Then below the outline, 
- appendix information
- plan of action
- outstanding issues
-  archived notes still relevant to the project

Okay great. But there's an odd tension where I seem to be thinking of embedding section specific planning notes in the outline in one part, and thinking of doing it later. 

It's probably best that I keep them separate. But as one exception, I can follow Sean's lead and specify plans/intentions directly in my draft. The odds seem good that 

Whats the way to put this into action? Start with outline as the section to extend. Add notes/content from the planning note, then review all my notes for relevance to ICMR. Finish by adding my plan of action for the next couple days and updating my workflow doc with my decision. Do all that, then this note can be archived.

## Actual Work
First I switch to using a peek at the abstract. That's easy. Immediately though, I see notes in [[planning]] that don't already have a clear "place to go" in my outline. If I move it below to a plan of action section, I lose context. I'll try to do the skeleton of outline first, and then add stuff.

In [[planning]], I tried to break down my introduction into a bunch of smaller sections. Did I add content to any of them?

[[Abstraction]] has first few sentences of introduction
[[Instance Models]] has nothing but the word "To".
Rest seem empty.

In a proper outline...these would be subsections of introduction. So let's go with that. But what about the old stuff?

Ugh, this isn't working. I'm going to use planning as an issue document and refactor stuff as I go.

## Put Off
- Move reference to [[2022-05-15 Introduction Planning]] to somewhere later.
- Move section specific notes in [[planning]]
