    "If retrieved context theory and the differential encoding hypothesis are both true, then, we can expect learned item-and-contextual associations to be weaker for the second presentation of an item compared to its second, scaled by the amount of spacing between these presentations. Correspondingly, during recall of a studied list containing item repetitions, we would observe stronger contiguity between recalls of the repeated item and items presented near its first presentation compared to items presented near its second.\n",

    "To measure this predicted effect, we apply a modification of the -Lag-CRP analysis. Here, \"lag\" refers to the number of positions between two item presentations in a study list. Lag-CRP analyses measure the probability of making a recall transition of a particular positive or negative lag, conditional on transition to recall at that lag being possible. Under high temporal contiguity, recall transitions are largely to items with low lag from the last retrieved item and more rarely to items with high lag. \n",

    "To determine if recall for repeated items exhibits higher temporal contiguity for items near their first presentation compared to their second, we can perform separate Lag-CRP analyses across repeated items with \"lag\" computed based on either just the items' first presentations or their second presentations. Under the differential encoding hypothesis, transitions to items presented near a repeated item's second presentation should be suppressed compared to transitions to items presented near the repeated item's first presentation.\n",
