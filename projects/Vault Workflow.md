## Project Workflow
0. Develop plans, writings, and literature reviews in projects subdirectory in compmemlearn.
1. Code analysis functions and reproducible/extendable workflows in library and report_templates subdirectories in compmemlearn, respectively.
2. Pass audience-focused analysis outcomes and writings to submodules stored in projects subdirectory in compmemlearn. Outcomes and writings that aren't audience focused belong elsewhere. 
3. Compile selected writings and analysis outcomes in submodules into tex file(s) and pdf(s) using quarto and sync the repository with overleaf
4. Upon submission, just copy the relevant compmemlearn library subdirectory into the repo and instruct readers to `pip install -e` the product.

## Daily Notes
Daily notes can initially sketch ideas as they come to mind and log progress. But ultimately all information in a daily note should be redundant and ideally point to the note making the information redundant.

Applicable information includes not just insights and drafted communiques, but also decisions about goals and process. We can think of them as a possible first draft of the writing I do in a day. 

Once I make everything in a daily note redundant, I should move the note to archive, or at least out of root. 

## Note Content
Except for dailies, notes shouldn't be written like freeform diary entries. 

They should have an introduction clarifying why they exist and what they contain and informative titles summarizing this information. 

Their body should deliver only what is specified in the introduction; separate ideas should be in separate notes.

They should be written like documentation that other people could conceivably benefit from.

They should probably also usually be dated and otherwise specify information that would deprecate them. Deprecated notes should be archived and replaced.

They should be connected to other notes. At minimum, they should be connected to a specific project landing page.

Headers should mark and explain shifts in content focus. If content is detailed enough, I should refactor stuff under heading into a separate note. If content under a head gets outdated, I should refactor it and store the note in archive. Don't delete unless it's genuinely useless.

## Literature Notes
Should review the ideas I care about from the paper and provide enough information that I can search out the literature note again using the idea, title, or author as cue. Should include paper abstract, too.

Not freeform either. I will eventually revisit these notes as a stranger.

Project landing pages project need a literature section to ensure that notes are properly linked within the web.

## Project Landing Pages
Should summarize what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and point to and contextualize every project asset and note. Should also specify what I already have and what's missing and what I ought to work on next. So basically a networked project README.

A projects-wide landing page is also worthwhile, to help keep track of relationships between projects as well as the overall compmemlearn project, my research program.

Ideally, I'll be able to navigate through notes using the web representation. For that to work, links between notes have to meaningfully reflect what they have to do with one another. Titles also have to be pretty clear.

## Issues
I'll feel this out a bit more first.
