\markdownRendererHeadingOne{Context Maintenance and Retrieval within an Instance-Based Architecture}\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator
{}Our instance-based implementation of the context maintenance and retrieval model (InstanceCMR) realizes the retrieved context account of memory search \markdownRendererCite{1}+{as\markdownRendererNbsp{}articulated\markdownRendererNbsp{}by}{}{morton2016predictive} within the instance-based MINERVA 2 model architecture \markdownRendererCite{1}+{}{}{hintzman1984minerva}. To make comparison of architectures as straightforward as possible, mechanisms were deliberately specified to be as similar to those of the original prototypical specification as possible except where required by the constraints of the instance-based architecture.\markdownRendererInterblockSeparator
